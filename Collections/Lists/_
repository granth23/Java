LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
Doubly linked means each node has a reference to the previous and next node.
Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list.

ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.
Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array.
If any element is removed from the array, all the other elements are shifted in memory.

Vector has higher overhead than ArrayList because Vector is synchronized to make it safe for use in
programs with multiple threads.
